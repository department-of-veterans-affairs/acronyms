MPI contains over 48 million person identities, populated from VA medical facilities, VA Administrations, and external sharing partners (e.g., DoD). MPI facilitates matching and linking of system records entered for a person using a unique identifier, the person's ICN. This enables the sharing of person information and an enterprise-wide view of a person's record including the person's longitudinal EHR.",
